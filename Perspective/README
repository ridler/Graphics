By Forrest Tagg Ridler | forrest.ridler@colorado.edu

Instructions:

arrow keys = natural rotation
'm' = toggle obilisks/spheres (there's two scenes)
'p' = toggle between perspective and orthagonal projections
'ESC' = terminate program

when in perspective mode:
'+' = zoom in (modify field of view)
'-' = zoom out (modify field of view)

when the spheres are displayed:
'c/C' = decrease/increase the distance between the spheres

This assignment took me about 2.5 hours.
