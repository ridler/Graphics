Modifiable Lorez Attractor:
By Forrest Tagg Ridler | forrest.ridler@colorado.edu


Strange Attractor Instructions:

'+' = zoom in
'-' = zoom out
'z/Z' = rotate z-axis
arrow keys = natural rotation
's' = decrease s parameter (increase with 'S')
'b' = decrease b parameter (increase with 'B')
'r' = decrease r parameter (increase with 'R')
'i' = toggle on-screne display of the parameters
'ESC' = terminate program


What I Learned:

In my opinion, the neatest thing to do is hold 's' and watch what happens as it becomes more and more negative.  At s ~ -3, the system appears to 'blow up.'

This assignment took approximately 5-6 hours.
