Scene With Textured Obilisks:
By Forrest Tagg Ridler | forrest.ridler@colorado.edu

Instructions:

arrow keys = natural rotation
'ESC' = terminate program
'+' = zoom in (modify field of view)
'-' = zoom out (modify field of view)
's' = stop or start light orbit
'<' = increase light elevation
'>' = decrease light elevation

DO NOT HOLD THESE BUTTONS (just press them):
'v' = decrease light orbit speed
'V' = increase light orbit speed

This assignment took me about 4 hours.
